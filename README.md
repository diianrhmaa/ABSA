🎓 Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) for Open-Ended Survey Responses

This project implements an Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) system specifically designed to analyze open-ended survey responses. The goal is to extract meaningful insights by identifying specific aspects mentioned in free-text answers and classifying the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) associated with each aspect.
🧠 Key Features

    🔍 Aspect Extraction: Automatically detects key aspects/topics from open-ended responses.

    💬 Sentiment Classification: Determines the sentiment (positive, negative) for each identified aspect.

    🛠️ Text Preprocessing: Includes cleaning, case folding, tokenization, normalization + synonym, and stopword removal.

    📊 Output: Sentiment summary per aspect for easier interpretation.

🧪 Use Case
